# vSRX single data center edge
{: #vcsvsrx-planning}

{:external: target="_blank" .external}
{:tip: .tip}
{:note: .note}
{:important: .important}

The default deployment of a vSRX HA Chassis Cluster places a pair of KVM based hosts with each supporting a single vSRX node. The two vSRX nodes are tied together in a highly available chassis cluster. The vSRX cluster delivers a reliable gateway solution that provides for continuous network traffic flows through the loss of a host supporting a node or a vSRX node.

While the current vSRX offering leverages KVM as the underlying host operating system, vSRX is also available in a configuration that runs natively on the VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor.
{: note}

These features are common to both deployment types.
- Provides high availability pair within a single data center.
  - Pair of vSRX gateway appliance hosts.
  - NFS storage shared between the hosts.
- Full vSRX firewall and routing capability implemented.

The following features are unique to a deployment with the ESXi as the host OS.
- VXLAN connectivity into a vCenter Server instance.
- Ability to host additional VMs on the edge services cluster.
  - NSX edges, load balancers, etc.

The basic vSRX offering architecture simply places a vSRX in front of all the VLANs deployed into a given customer account. The vSRX is a powerful Vyatta replacement for situations in which a customer controlled gateway appliance is desirable.

The following figure represents the typical vSRX deployment on KVM and a basic vSRX deployment in which the hypervisor is ESXi.

The deployment of the VMware vCenter Server instance is required before the vSRX edge gateway appliance order is placed.

## Understanding the default vSRX configuration
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-default-vsrx}

Understanding the default configuration assists in both an understanding of the vSRX HA Chassis Cluster and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} underlay networking. The default configuration is the base upon which all further integration is executed.

For more information, see [Understanding the vSRX Default Configuration](/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-understanding-the-vsrx-default-configuration#understanding-the-vsrx-default-configuration) and [IBM Cloud IaaS vSRX default configuration](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcsvsrx-iaas-def-config).

## vSRX and vCenter Server integrated design
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-vsrx-design}

![Figure 2 - vSRX and vCenter Server integration](../../images/vcsvsrx-vsrx-with-vcs-architecture.svg){: caption="Figure 2. vSRX and vCenter Server integration" caption-side="bottom"}

The tight integration of the vSRX HA Chassis Cluster into a vCenter Server instance extends the basic vCenter Server architecture in a few key areas.

### vCenter Server cluster design
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-vcs-design}

When a standard vCenter Server instance is deployed to a customer account it is typically a single hyper-converged cluster in which compute, management and edge functions are delivered by a single three ESXi host (NFS shared storage) or four node (VSAN shared storage) cluster configuration.

The addition of the vSRX offering on ESXi impacts the basic vCenter Server design by moving the edge services out of the hyper-converged cluster onto a dedicated two ESXi host cluster. The edge services cluster is managed by the existing vCenter Server deployed with the initial vCenter Server instance.

#### Host sizing
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-host-sizing}

The current vSRX offering has limited hardware options for deployment. Since these options are not variable, it is recommended that you review the options available in the [IBM Cloud infrastructure customer portal](https://control.softlayer.com/network/gatewayappliances).

### Network design
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-network-design}

The vCenter Server offering is designed to manage east-west network traffic at the SDN layer by using NSX distributed logical routers (DLR) and virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEP) on each ESXi host and north-south traffic via NSX edge services gateways (ESG). The vSRX is not a replacement for the DLR but could either assist or potentially replace the ESG firewall services in managing the north-south traffic flows.

The required network design changes are modest and include all customer VM traffic no matter the destination, platform management traffic, direct link traffic, where applicable, and internet bound traffic. Traffic explicitly excluded includes VTEP traffic, storage traffic and vMotion traffic.

NSX may be extended from the compute cluster to the edge services cluster or the use of BGP over an IPsec VPN may be used to enable connectivity between the edge and compute clusters. Where traffic flowing between the vCenter Server compute cluster and the edge services cluster is not in conflict with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure  assigned subnets the use of a local VLAN and subnet is suitable as a transit link.

BGP over IPsec VPN is the preferred method of connecting to a customer on-premises data center whether the connection traverses the internet or passes between the customer and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} via one of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure direct link offerings.

#### Interface mapping for vSRX on VMware
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-interface-map}

The vSRX on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} vCenter Server platform has very specific connection requirements to enable and maintain the HA chassis cluster.

![Figure 3 - vSRX HA chassis cluster on vCenter Server interconnections](../../images/vcsvsrx-vsrx-vcs-connections.svg){: caption="Figure 3. vSRX HA chassis cluster on vCenter Server interconnections" caption-side="bottom"}

Each network adapter defined on the vSRX is mapped to a specific interface, depending on whether the vSRX instance is a standalone VM or one of a cluster pair for high availability.

Note the following:

In standalone mode:
- fxp0 is the out-of-band management interface.
- ge-0/0/0 is the first traffic (revenue) interface.

In cluster mode:

- fxp0 is the out-of-band management interface.
- em0 is the cluster control link for both nodes.
- Any of the traffic interfaces can be specified as the fabric links, such as ge-0/0/0 for fab0 on node 0 and ge-7/0/0 for fab1 on node 1.

The following table shows information for a standalone vSRX VM.

Network adapter|Interface name in Junos OS
---|---
1|fxp0
2|ge-0/0/0
3|ge-0/0/1
4|ge-0/0/2
5|ge-0/0/3
6|ge-0/0/4
7|ge-0/0/5
8|ge-0/0/6
{: caption="Table 1. Interface names and mappings for a standalone vSRX VM" caption-side="top"}

The following table shows information for a pair of vSRX VMs in a cluster (node 0 and node 1).

Network adapter|Interface name in Junos OS
---|---
1|fxp0 (node 0 and 1)
2|em0 (node 0 and 1)
3|ge-0/0/0 (node 0) & ge-7/0/0 (node 1)
4|ge-0/0/1 (node 0) & ge-7/0/1 (node 1)
5|ge-0/0/2 (node 0) & ge-7/0/2 (node 1)
6|ge-0/0/3 (node 0) & ge-7/0/3 (node 1)
7|ge-0/0/4 (node 0) & ge-7/0/4 (node 1)
8|ge-0/0/5 (node 0) & ge-7/0/5 (node 1)
{: caption="Table 2. Interface names and mappings for a pair of vSRX VMs in a cluster (node 0 and node 1)" caption-side="top"}

#### Default security zone configuration
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-default-sec-zone}

The following table shows the factory default settings for security policies.

Source zone|Destination zone|Policy action
---|---|---
trust|untrust|permit
trust|trust|permit
untrust|trust|deny
{: caption="Table 3. Factory default settings for security policies" caption-side="top"}

As noted previously, the default configuration merely represents a point from which to build the required configuration to meet your requirements. The creation of additional security zones is often necessary to support the various traffic flow patterns present in the account.

## vSRX to client on-premises connections
{: #vcsvsrx-planning-client-config}

The preferred method of linking the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} vCenter Server instance to a client's existing on-premises data center is BGP.  

If the client intends to connect over the internet using eBGP they either must obtain a public autonomous system number (ASN) or use BGP over an IPsec VPN to permit the use of private ASNs.

Where the client is using Direct Link then BGP using private ASNs is possible.

![Figure 4 - vSRX BGP over IBM Direct Link](../../images/vcsvsrx-bgp-direct-link.svg){: caption="Figure 4. vSRX BGP over IBM Direct Link" caption-side="bottom"}

The diagram illustrates one of many potential implementations of BGP from the on-premises data center to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The traffic originating from the client facility flows through AT&T NetBond or other provider into the GNPP router. The GNPP router is peered via BGP to the vSRX gateway deployed into the client's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and all traffic is encapsulated in a GRE tunnel over BGP. The packets exiting the tunnel into the vSRX are then routed to the NSX overlay network via an edge services gateway.
